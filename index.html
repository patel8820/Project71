                    <p>Project PARKA began in the students' software engineering course, when they decided they wanted to develop a software product that detects the number of empty and occupied spots in a parking lot. They used a Raspberry Pi (a single-board computer) to run the code, which is developed in Python (a high-level programming language). They also built a physical model to demonstrate how the product works and are in the process of developing a mobile application, which will allow users to use the software product.</p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choiceEach student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at
